## Attributions
* #### `angular-seed`
   * I used `angular-seed` to bootstrap this AngularJS app.  
   * The `angular-seed` [Readme](./angular-seed-info/README.md) and [license](./angular-seed-info/LICENSE) are located   in the `angular-seed-info` directory which sits directly inside this directory (`/client`).
  * Visit the [`angular-seed` repository](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) here.

## Note
This file provides limited information about the front end (the `client` directory) of this app.  For complete app information, see [`README.md`](../README.md) in the root directory of this project (`Delux-Bill-Splitter`).

## Project Goals
* Write a complete AngularJS app. (This is my first major project built with AngularJS.)
* Modularize code as much as is practical.
  * Use many components to gain experience working with components and become as familiar as possible with AngularJS components.
  * Use components for repeated or similar page elements to avoid repetition and allow for easier maintenance.
  * Separate concerns to create components that can be easily reused in other apps or other places within this app. Do this whenever it is practical and does not cause excessive complications.
* Follow the overall Project Goals defined in the main project Readme, [`/README.md`](../README.md)

## Technologies Used
* AngularJS
* Node
* Other Node packages:
  * angular-seed
